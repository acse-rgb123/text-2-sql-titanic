```sql
SELECT name, age, sex, fare, survived 
FROM passengers 
WHERE survived = 1 AND fare > 50;
```

2. Query 2: Retrieve the total number of passengers by each ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
```sql
SELECT pclass, COUNT(passenger_id) AS passenger_count 
FROM passengers 
GROUP BY pclass;
```

3. Query 3: List all passengers who embarked from Southampton (port code 'S') and survived.
```sql
SELECT name, age, sex, fare, embarked, survived 
FROM passengers 
WHERE embarked = 'S' AND survived = 1;
```

4. Query 4: Get the survival rate for male and female passengers.
```sql
SELECT sex, AVG(survived) AS survival_rate 
FROM passengers 
GROUP BY sex;
```

5. Query 5: Find the top 5 most expensive fares paid by passengers who did not survive.
```sql
SELECT name, fare 
FROM passengers 
WHERE survived = 0 
ORDER BY fare DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

6. Query 6: Count the number of passengers who embarked from each port.
```sql
SELECT embarked, COUNT(passenger_id) AS passenger_count 
FROM passengers 
GROUP BY embarked;
```

7. Query 7: Get the average fare paid by passengers in each class who survived.
```sql
SELECT pclass, AVG(fare) AS avg_fare 
FROM passengers 
WHERE survived = 1 
GROUP BY pclass;
```

8. Query 8: Find the number of children (under 18) who survived, grouped by ticket class.
```sql
SELECT pclass, COUNT(passenger_id) AS child_survivors 
FROM passengers 
WHERE age < 18 AND survived = 1 
GROUP BY pclass;
```
